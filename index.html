        <p>If there's one thing we love at Coffee and Code, it's building web software.</p> 
        <p>If there are two things we love, they're probably tacos and web software...But, we still love coffee and it's a big part of how we got to where we are as a company.</p>
        <p>We'll be celebrating National Coffee Day this Thursday September 29<sup>th</sup> at <a href="http://www.artisancoffeeshop.com/">Artisan Coffee</a>. We'll be working from there in the morning, from 9:30 until lunchtime. We'd love to work alongside you, share our favorite brews, and talk shop. Hope to see you there!</p>
